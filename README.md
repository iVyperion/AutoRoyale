### How to use (Video guide coming soon)
1.) Install [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) (or any other android emulator)

2.) - Install [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) if you haven't already.

3.) Launch clash royale on the emulator and fullscreen it so the locations of everything on the screen remains consistent.

4.) Download and unzip the project from releases, or compile it yourself.

5.) Run ColorFinder.

6.) Edit cfg.txt (in the config folder) so it's set up properly.
