## âš™ Setup
1.) First download the latest version from https://github.com/kite03/AutoRoyale/releases

2.) Run colorfinder.exe

3.) The program will print a ton of data. The first number is the x co-ordinate, the second number is the y co-ordinate, and the third number is the color of that pixel.

4.) Now go into the "config" folder and open "config.json"

5.) Replace each item with the correct pixel location and colour as given to you by the colorfinder.exe
